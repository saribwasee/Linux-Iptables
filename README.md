IP-Tables Usage

Iptables is a user-space utility program that allows a system administrator to configure the IP packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall. The term iptables is also commonly used to inclusively refer to the kernel-level components. x_tables is the name of the kernel module carrying the shared code portion used by all four modules that also provides the API used for extensions; subsequently, Xtables is more or less used to refer to the entire firewall (v4, v6, arp, and eb) architecture.

INPUT modules will use for incomming traffic to our host similarly OUTPUT will use for outgoing traffic and FORWARD will use to all packets that have been routed and were not for local delivery will traverse this chain.
